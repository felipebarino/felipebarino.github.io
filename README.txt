   abstract = {In this work, we report on a new interrogation method for long-period fiber-grating (LPFG) sensors. This type of sensor has been gaining increasing attention due its several interesting practical and metrological advantages. However, the LPFG optical signal is complex and could be difficult to process. We present a novel approach to the LPFG resonant wavelength detection and tracking using a multifilter LPFG interrogator. Multifilter LPFG interrogators present a great solution for LPFG sensor interrogation because there is no need for a priori knowledge concerning the LPFG sensor spectrum. We present a novel source-compensating preprocessing and a fuzzy inference system (FIS) to track the LPFG resonant wavelength. Our proposal was compared to two baseline models: a simple linear regression and an artificial neural network. Our results showed the new approach could reduce resonant wavelength uncertainty by almost three times comparing to results found in the literature.},

The utilization of fiber-optic sensors (FOSs) emerges as a promising approach due to their efficient optical transmission, minimal signal attenuation, and resistance to electromagnetic interference. These optical sensors have demonstrated success in diverse structures, including bridges and nuclear plants, especially in challenging environments. This article culminates with the depiction of the development of an array of sensors featuring Fiber Bragg Gratings (FBGs). This array is designed to measure deformation and temperature in protective grids surrounding the turbines at the Santo Antônio Hydroelectric Plant.

However, the traditional methods of monitoring the fermentation process are subjective, expensive, and time-consuming. In this study, we developed a novel approach using electronic CO2 and temperature sensors, combined with a 3-D-printed encapsulation, to monitor and characterize the coffee fermentation process. Our methodology involved the following steps: Development of a sensor probe for aroma characterization during the coffee fermentation process, implementation of a robust data processing pipeline, including clustering techniques and principal component analysis (PCA), to effectively identify and classify aromas, collection of data from the sensor probe throughout the fermentation process, and analysis of the collected data to identify patterns and trends that correlate with different stages of the fermentation process. The results of our study demonstrate that our proposed approach is an effective and reliable tool for monitoring and characterizing the coffee fermentation process. Our findings suggest that the use of electronic sensors and data processing techniques has the potential to significantly improve the quality and efficiency of coffee production.},

Two MZIs, based on a combination of a fiber taper cascaded by a micro-tapered long-period fiber grating, were installed in a fermentation barrel to monitor the liquids and gases released during the fermentation process. During this process, a variety of odors arise due to the yeast activity and their classification is important to decide when to stop the fermentation process. In this work, we show that the in-fiber MZIs are good candidates for optical noses in this scenario.},

We analyze the transverse strain sensing characteristics, such as load intensity and azimuthal angle, based on the birefringence effect induced in LPG sensor. Therefore, we employ the different orthogonal responses of the grating to develop regression methods, which allow the estimation of the strain behavior of the LPG sensor. The predictive performances of these interrogation models are compared in terms of square correlation coefficient (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE). Finally, the results indicate that the best method to predict load intensity is the Fourth-Degree Polynomial Fit, whereas the artificial neural network (ANN) model could be successfully employed to predict the azimuthal angle.},

The proposed sensing technology combines a Long-Period Fiber Grating sensor and a permanent Neodymium magnet, providing a small and flexible sensing scheme deployed inside the arm of the drone. The experimental results show that good accuracy and linear electric current sensitivity of 0.21 A and 2.08 A/nm, respectively, were achieved with electric current measurements at a 100 Hz sampling rate. The values of hysteresis and repeatability achieved were 0.08 A and 0.22 A, respectively. Finally, a Robot Operating System package for interfacing with the sensing system was developed and tested, which greatly simplifies the deployment of the sensor in robotics applications.},
