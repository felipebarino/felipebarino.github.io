									Learning Models for Long-Period Fiber Grating Signal Conditioning Using Monte Carlo

							<p>
								<strong>Abstract:</strong> The massive adoption of machine learning (ML) and artificial
								intelligence models in the field of instrumentation and measurement has raised several
								doubts concerning the validity of their response and the methodology for estimating their
								errors. In this study, we revisit ML models that were used to interrogate long-period fiber
								grating sensors. We used these models to present a comprehensive analysis of the uncertainty
								propagation through the ML-based optical fiber sensor signal conditioning. The uncertainty
								propagation was studied using the Monte Carlo method. The results showed the proposed models
								were capable to damp some optoelectronic noises, don’t induce systematic errors under noise,
								and that the noise-damping effect of the ML models doesn’t impact the interrogator’s
								resolution. Moreover, we hope that this work serves as a methodological framework for the
								evaluation of uncertainty of ML-based optical sensor interrogators.

								measurement instrument using optical fiber sensor</a></h3>
							<p>
								<strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper presents a novel optical fiber sensor for 
								measuring the bitterness of beer samples. The sensor is based on a Mach–Zehnder 
								interferometer (MZI) composed of two long-period fiber gratings (LPFGs). 
								The sensor exploits the sensitivity of the LPFGs to the refractive index of 
								the surrounding medium, which varies according to the concentration of 
								iso-alpha-acids that cause bitterness in beer. The sensor uses a two-point 
								on-line self-calibrating procedure to estimate the bitterness of unknown 
								samples by comparison with reference samples of known bitterness. 
								The sensor performance was evaluated in both laboratory and factory settings, 
								showing good repeatability, reproducibility, and low bias. The proposed sensor 
								offers a fast, simple, and low-cost alternative to the conventional method of 
								measuring beer bitterness based on UV spectroscopy. The sensor can be integrated 
								into the Industry 4.0 framework to improve the quality and consistency of beer 
								production.

							<p>
								<strong>Abstract:</strong> The coffee fermentation process is a crucial step in the
								production of high-quality coffee. However, the traditional methods of monitoring the
								fermentation process are subjective, expensive, and time-consuming. In this study, we
								developed a novel approach using electronic CO2 and temperature sensors, combined with a

								methodology involved the following steps: Development of a sensor probe for aroma
								characterization during the coffee fermentation process, implementation of a robust data
								processing pipeline, including clustering techniques and Principal Component Analysis, to
								effectively identify and classify aromas, collection of data from the sensor probe
								throughout the fermentation process, analysis of the collected data to identify patterns and
								trends that correlate with different stages of the fermentation process. The results of our
								study demonstrate that our proposed approach is an effective and reliable tool for
								monitoring and characterizing the coffee fermentation process. Our findings suggest that the
								use of electronic sensors and data processing techniques has the potential to significantly
								improve the quality and efficiency of coffee production.

							<strong>Abstract:</strong> In this work we report on a new interrogation method for
							Long-period fiber grating (LPFG) sensors. This type of sensor has been gaining increasing
							attention due its several interesting practical and metrological advantages. However, the
							LPFG optical signal is complex and could be difficult to process. We present a novel
							approach to the LPFG resonant wavelength detection and tracking using a multi-filter LPFG
							interrogator. Multi-filter LPFG interrogators present a great solution for LPFG sensor
							interrogation because there is no need for a priori knowledge concerning the LPFG sensor
							spectrum. We present a novel source-compensating preprocessing and a fuzzy inference system
							to track the LPFG resonant wavelength. Our proposal was compared to two baseline models: a
							simple linear regression and an artificial neural network. Our results showed the new
							approach could reduce resonant wavelength uncertainty by almost three times comparing to

							<strong>Abstract:</strong> In this work, we present a low-cost tactile sensor based on
							arc-induced long–period fiber grating (LPG) embedded in polylactic acid (PLA) by fused
							deposition modeling (FDM). The 3d printing process used to embed the LPG, offers easy

						<p>
							<strong>Abstract:</strong> Optical fiber sensors have been used in several applications due
							to their unique advantages, such as immunity to electromagnetic interference, small size,
							light-weight, and robustness, for example. Long-period fiber grating (LPFG) is a type of
							fiber sensor with great sensitivity to several parameters, including the surrounding
							refractive index. However, the challenge in using LPFGs lies in their interrogation, which
							relates the change in optical characteristics with the measurand. This paper presents a
							novel method for the interrogation of LPFG sensors. This method uses a single FBG attached
							to a vibrating piezoelectric component and harmonic analysis of the optical power reflected
							by the FBG filter to estimate the resonant wavelength of an LPFG. The method was simulated
							to process several arc-induced LPFG spectra and achieved results comparable to the baseline
							method for half of the test set and improved by roughly 5 times the accuracy and precision
							by limiting the dynamic range.

							<strong>Abstract:</strong> Information about future streamflow is important for hydropower
