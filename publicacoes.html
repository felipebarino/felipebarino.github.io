										<h3><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9926187/">A fuzzy approach to LPFG-based optical sensor processing and interrogation</a></h3>
										<p>
											<strong>Abstract:</strong> In this work we report on a new interrogation method for Long-period fiber grating (LPFG) sensors. This type of sensor has been gaining increasing attention due its several interesting practical and metrological advantages. However, the LPFG optical signal is complex and could be difficult to process. We present a novel approach to the LPFG resonant wavelength detection and tracking using a multi-filter LPFG interrogator. Multi-filter LPFG interrogators present a great solution for LPFG sensor interrogation because there is no need for a priori knowledge concerning the LPFG sensor spectrum. We present a novel source-compensating preprocessing and a fuzzy inference system to track the LPFG resonant wavelength. Our proposal was compared to two baseline models: a simple linear regression and an artificial neural network. Our results showed the new approach could reduce resonant wavelength uncertainty by almost three times comparing to results found in the literature.

										<h3> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.optlastec.2021.107697">3d-printed force sensitive structure using embedded long-period fiber grating. In: Optics and laser technology</a></h3>
										<p>
											<strong>Abstract:</strong> In this work, we present a low-cost tactile sensor based on arc-induced long–period fiber grating (LPG) embedded in polylactic acid (PLA) by fused deposition modeling (FDM). The 3d printing process used to embed the LPG, offers easy customization, flexibility, fast prototyping, and low-cost fabrication. At the same time, optical fiber sensors such as fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) and LPGs are compact, resistant, and immune to electromagnetic interference. Therefore, the easy fabrication and low cost of arc-induced LPGs coupled to the 3d printing advantages offer low-cost custom force sensing elements with all the advantages of optical fiber sensors. This way, the proposed tactile sensor is a lightweight, small-size, and cost-effective tactile sensing scheme that offers easy implementation and tailoring to specific applications. In this study, we fabricated, embedded, calibrated, and evaluated the proposed LPG sensor tactile sensor. We showed this approach provided high force sensitivity (11.723&nbsp;nm.N<sup>−1</sup>) with high linearity (99.28<!-- -->&nbsp;<!-- -->%), sub-decimal measurement error, and no drift.

										<h3><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yofte.2022.102940">Long-period fiber grating sensor interrogation with single strain modulated FBG and harmonic analysis</a></h3>
										<p>
											<strong>Abstract:</strong> Optical fiber sensors have been used in several applications due to their unique advantages, such as immunity to electromagnetic interference, small size, light-weight, and robustness, for example. Long-period fiber grating (LPFG) is a type of fiber sensor with great sensitivity to several parameters, including the surrounding refractive index. However, the challenge in using LPFGs lies in their interrogation, which relates the change in optical characteristics with the measurand. This paper presents a novel method for the interrogation of LPFG sensors. This method uses a single FBG attached to a vibrating piezoelectric component and harmonic analysis of the optical power reflected by the FBG filter to estimate the resonant wavelength of an LPFG. The method was simulated to process several arc-induced LPFG spectra and achieved results comparable to the baseline method for half of the test set and improved by roughly 5 times the accuracy and precision by limiting the dynamic range.

										<h3><a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/mop.32599">Two-dimensional long-period fiber grating sensor for touch applications</a></h3>
										<p>
											<strong>Abstract:</strong> In this study we present a two-dimensional force sensor based on a single long-period fiber grating (LPG) to be applied to robotic manipulators grasping control. The measuring force is applied to the fiber transverse section and this lateral compression induces birefringence on the fiber, which splits the LPG resonant dip into two. We track these dips using polarized controlled light and process the LPG spectra using artificial neural networks to determine the force intensity and direction. Finally, our single sensor proposal for 2D forces measurement can estimate an applied force with 0.2148 N and 5.977 deg. error.

										<h3><a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2020.3042779">Loading Condition Estimation Using Long-Period Fiber Grating Array</a></h3>
										<p>
											<strong>Abstract:</strong> To ensure the safety and durability of structures, the constant monitoring of their structural health has been used by engineers to manage these structures. Optical fiber sensors have the advantage of long transducer-to-processing distances, the capacity to work in harsh environments, immunity to electromagnetic noise, and reliability. Therefore, optical fiber sensors are great candidates to monitor structures in-service. Here, we propose the use of a long-period fiber grating (LPG) array to monitor the loading condition of a structure. The identification method was tested in a simply-supported beam model and the estimated loading conditions were compared to the loading conditions applied to the beam. By analyzing different combinations of force intensity and position along the beam length, the results showed the force position could be estimated with 0.901% accuracy and force intensity with 2.51% accuracy using a four-LPG strain sensor array.

										<h3><a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2020.3007957">LPG Interrogator Based on FBG Array and Artificial Neural Network</a></h3>
										<p>
											<strong>Abstract:</strong> This work introduces a new method for long-period fiber grating (LPG) sensors interrogation. This proposal uses a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) array to extract spectral information of the LPG sensor and an Artificial Neural Network to process this information. The information is processed to estimate the LPG resonant wavelength, without prior knowledge on the LPG spectrum. Therefore, the interrogator is LPG-insensitive, can be easily manufactured by optical fiber sensors laboratories at low-cost and is suitable for in-field applications. We demonstrated the filter array and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) design, which are the proposed interrogator core. Furthermore, we analyzed the interrogation performance by the Mean Squared Error (MSE), the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and the distribution of the residuals. The results showed our proposal can estimate the LPG resonant wavelength with 2.82 nm uncertainty, considering a 95% confidence interval, over 75 nm dynamic range for several LPGs, with different spectral characteristics. Moreover, our proposal can be easily tailored for different dynamic ranges and resolutions with proper adjustments on the FBG array and MLP.

										<h3><a href="https://doi.org/10.1590/2179-10742020v19i11809">Transverse Load Discrimination in Long-Period Fiber Grating via Artificial Neural Network</a></h3>
										<p>
											<strong>Abstract:</strong> We present a general investigation of a Long-Period Grating (LPG) for transverse strain measurement. The transverse strain sensing characteristics, for instance, the load intensity and azimuthal angle, are analyzed with the data set generated by the LPG sensor and probed by artificial neural network (ANN). Furthermore, we evaluate and compare the predictive performance of the interrogation model considering the square correlation coefficient (R<sup>2</sup>), root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The results indicate that the ANN model could be successfully employed to estimate the load intensity and azimuthal angle using a single LPG sensor.

										<h3><a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3040942">Correlated Time-Series in Multi-Day-Ahead Streamflow Forecasting Using Convolutional Networks</a></h3>
										<p>
											<strong>Abstract:</strong> Information about future streamflow is important for hydropower production planning, especially for damless hydro-power plants. The river flow is a reflection of various hydrological, hydrogeological, and meteorological factors, which increases the direct modeling difficulty, and favors the use of data-driven methods. In this paper, we propose the use of one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1d-CNN) for multi-day ahead river flow forecasting and we present a multi-input model using correlated-input time-series. The proposed model was applied at the Madeira River, the Amazon's largest and most important tributary, near the Santo Antônio damless hydro-power plant. We compared the proposed correlated-input 1d-CNN to a single-input 1d-CNN model and some baseline models. Furthermore, we conclude that 1d-CNN performed better than all baseline models and that the correlated-input forecasting model is 5 times smaller than the single-input equivalent with accuracy improvements.

										<h3><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.measurement.2019.07.017">Comparison of regression methods for transverse load sensor based on optical fiber long-period grating</a></h3>
										<p>
											<strong>Abstract:</strong> In this work, we report the comparison of regression methods in a long-period grating (LPG) for transverse strain measurement. We analyze the transverse strain sensing characteristics, such as load intensity and azimuthal angle, based on the birefringence effect induced in LPG sensor. Therefore, we employ the different orthogonal responses of the grating to develop regression methods, which allow the estimation of the strain behavior of the LPG sensor. The predictive performances of these interrogation models are compared in terms of square correlation coefficient (R<sup>2</sup>) and root mean square error (RMSE). Finally, the results indicate that the best method to predict load intensity is the Fourth-Degree Polynomial Fit, whereas the artificial neural network (ANN) model could be successfully employed to predict the azimuthal angle.

										<h3>Resumo</h3>
										<p>
											Para garantir a segurança e durabilidade de estruturas em serviço, o monitoramento constante da saúde estrutural destas vem sendo utilizado por engenheiros para melhor gerenciamento, tomada de decisões e planejamento de manutenção. Neste cenário, sistemas de sensoriamento são extremamente importantes. Este trabalho apresenta o uso de sensores ópticos a fibra baseados em grades de período longo (LPFGs, do inglês long period fiber gratings) na identificação de forças em estruturas. Sensores ópticos a fibra são interessantes para monitorar estruturas em tempo real devido à capacidade de lidar com ambientes hostis, imunidade eletromagnética e baixa atenuação do sinal. Nesta dissertação são analisados dois cenários: identificação de um carregamento concentrado em uma viga biapoiada e identificação de forças bidimensionais por meio da compressão da LPFG. No primeiro caso, desenvolveu-se um modelo matemático para identificação da intensidade e posição de uma força aplicada a tal viga, obtendo um erro absoluto relativo de, em média, 1,22% na estimativa da intensidade e 2,51% na estimativa da posição. Já no segundo caso, um modelo de regressão baseado em aprendizado de máquinas foi utilizado para identificar a intensidade e direção de uma força com erro absoluto relativo de, em média, 2,19% e 3,93%, respectivamente.
